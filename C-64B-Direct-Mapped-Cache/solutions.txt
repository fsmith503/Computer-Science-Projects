A. What is the total number of memory writes? It may help to think in terms of movl instructions.
 
 The number of memory writes is 4*16*16. This is because there are 4 writes in the for loop, the inner for
 loop is executed 16 times. The outer loop is executed 16 times. Thus we have 4*16*16 memory writes which is
 1024.

B. What is the total number of memory writes that miss in the cache?
 
 we have 1024 writes and the miss rate is 1 in every 8 so we divide
 1024/8 to get which gives us 128

C. What is the miss rate?

1 in every 8
