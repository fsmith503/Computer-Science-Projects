// need to make a class for every file
// everything in Java is a class
// have a main function but wrapped up in a class
// name of class be the same exact name as name of the file
// then we need a main function
// main function is the entry point into the program
// operating system is calling your program similar as to how you would call a function
// when the OS runs program it dosent know where to begin unless you tell it and you tell it 
// by giving it a main function
// highest level function in program its the funciton thats ran first
// in main function you can call other funcitons
// to compile you type javac filename.java
// to run you type java helloworld
// add java compiler to my path
// when you type javac you are envoking java compiler
// command execution -> javac HelloWorld.java
// java HelloWorld
public class HelloWorld{

	public static void main(String[] args){
		System.out.println("Hello World!");
