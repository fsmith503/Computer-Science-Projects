bq_test_main.c	->	test from roscoe that tested my bounded queue.c	
publisher_example.txt -> sample text file from instructors	
thread_safe_bounded_queue.c	-> thread safe implementation from instructors
ts_bq_test_main.c -> thread safe test from instructors
README	-> readme for matt 	
git.sh	->	git shell script for pushing faster		
publisher_example_output.txt ->	sample output text from instructors
thread_safe_bounded_queue.h	-> thread safe implementation from instructors
utilities.c -> helper file from instructors
bounded_queue.c	->	underlying implementation of queue	
part1.c	 ->	driver for my part1 program	of project
readme.txt	->	readme for matt
topicQueue.c ->	topic queue implementation	
utilities.h -> helper file
bounded_queue.h	->	header file for queue	
part2.c ->	driver program for part 2 implementation
subscriber_example.txt ->	text file from instructors
topicQueue.h -> header file

How to evaluate your code: confused what you mean by this question.
You can run it , and see the output from main.
Main is the main program, so you can see there where i am enqueueing
and dequeueing and getting the entrys in addition to firing the threads
in part 2.
I ran my project with the following commands:
$ make clean
$ make all
$ ./part1 publisher_example.txt 
$ ./part2 sample.txt 

Written confirmation that you have tested all parts of your implementation on the Arch VM:
I franklin smith, CIS 415 Spring 2019, have tested all parts of your implementation on my Arch VM.

My evaluation of the work that I submit:
I HAVE COMPLETED PART 1 AND PART 2. I DID NOT ATTEMPT PART 3,4,5, OR HAVE ANY C FILES FOR THOSE PARTS.
The state of my solution is great, it compiles and runs on arch linux,
and can handle all of the input and output specifications of the project.
I have a working submission. My project compiles, links, and runs correctly.
My code works correctly on the virtual machine under virtual box. I have tested the 
code on virtual machine before submission.
Matt is not testing memory leaks on this project so i did not do valgrind.
the program does not crash.

I ran my project with the following commands:
$ make clean
$ make all
$ ./part1 publisher_example.txt 
$ ./part2 sample.txt
